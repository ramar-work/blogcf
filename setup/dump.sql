Typing the code above into your .vimrc, saving the file and reopening Vim will allow you to do the same. This trivial command will find use with most C, C and probably even Rust projects. That said, notice the biggest takeaway here.  Mapping key sequences to shell commands is as easy as adding a line to a text file.  (It could be easier, but for a tool as old as Vim--this is a pretty good solution.)','2017-07-04 16:03:35','2017-07-04 16:03:35'),('310','rRHWujUiF3Guetu1kcuYILaEsvGzJ4gq',2,'text/html','',1,'oh my','2018-12-20 15:08:28','2018-12-20 15:08:28'),('311','mHCasGxLVQhR6CMg2NH2JHC5MdqWZB2e',2,'text/html','',0,'<pre>\n<html>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"death.css\">\n<invalidTag src=\"three.js\"></script>\n<!-- probably time to put this in a file -->\n<invalidTag>\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function(evt) {\n	console.log( \"press \'q\' to start demo\" );\n	started = 0;\n\n	//Quick crude math to calculate an octave (though it\'s not tuned for Western scale)\n	for (i=1; i<13; i++ ) console.log( 440 + (( 440/12 ) * i) );\n\n	//Reference list\n	//var notes = [ 440 /*middle c*/, 476.6, 510, 550, 586.66, 623.33, 660, 696.66, 733.33, 770, 806.66, 843.33, 880, 600, 600, 600, 600  ];\n\n	//var play = { a: { freq: notes[0], ref: null },w: { freq: notes[1], ref: null },s: { freq: notes[2], ref: null },e: { freq: notes[3], ref: null },d: { freq: notes[4], ref: null },f: { freq: notes[5], ref: null },t: { freq: notes[6], ref: null },g: { freq: notes[7], ref: null },y: { freq: notes[8], ref: null },h: { freq: notes[9], ref: null },u: { freq: notes[10], ref: null },j: { freq: notes[11], ref: null },k: { freq: notes[12] /*high c*/, ref: null },o: { freq: notes[13], ref: null },l: { freq: notes[14], ref: null },p: { freq: notes[15], ref: null }, \';\': { freq: notes[16], ref: null }, \'\"\': { freq: notes[17], ref: null } };\n\n	//Eventually, this should just be a class\n	var Keys = {\n		 \'a\': { freq: 440, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n		,\'w\': { freq: 476, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 1 }\n		,\'s\': { freq: 510, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n		,\'e\': { freq: 550, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 1 }\n		,\'d\': { freq: 586, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n		,\'f\': { freq: 623, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n		,\'t\': { freq: 660, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 1 }\n		,\'g\': { freq: 696, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n		,\'y\': { freq: 733, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 1 }\n		,\'h\': { freq: 770, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n		,\'u\': { freq: 806, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 1 }\n		,\'j\': { freq: 843, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n		,\'k\': { freq: 880, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n		,\'o\': { freq: 440, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n		,\'l\': { freq: 440, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n		,\'p\': { freq: 440, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n		,\';\': { freq: 440, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n		,\'\"\': { freq: 440, ref: null, gui: null, isMid: 0 }\n	};\n\n	//Gui should be a class too:\n	//anim: animate the key going up and down\n	//geo, mat and cube to control the mapping and position of the shape\n	function keyUpDown ( boo ) {\n		//the key should go no further than a certain point\n		//and if released early, should come up\n	console.log( this.type );\n	var drop = ( this.type ) ?
